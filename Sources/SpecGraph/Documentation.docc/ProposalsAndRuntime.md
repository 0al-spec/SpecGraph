# Proposals and Runtime Evidence

SpecGraph treats proposal records and runtime evidence as connected surfaces.

## Proposal Records

Proposal markdown under `docs/proposals/` describes bounded changes and their
intended relationship to canonical specifications. Changes that affect proposal
documents should include matching tracking material or an explicit
documentation-only classification.

## Runtime Evidence

Runtime evidence lives in generated registries, viewer-facing JSON, and local
run artifacts. Evidence should support claims about realized behavior without
turning local runtime artifacts into canonical documentation by accident.

## Validation Gate

Use the proposal tracking gate when proposal documentation changes:

```bash
make proposal-tracking-gate
```
